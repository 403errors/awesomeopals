## What is Awesome Opals?

Awesome Opals is a revolutionary modular application platform designed to give you complete control over your digital experience. Instead of a bloated app with features you don't use, Opals lets you build your perfect workspace piece by piece.

Each feature is an **Opal**—a lightweight, powerful plugin that integrates seamlessly into the core platform.

## Why Opals?

- **Modular**: Install only what you need.
- **Community Driven**: Built by developers, for everyone.
- **Beautiful**: A premium, cohesive design system.

## Contributing Opals

We believe the best features come from the community. We encourage developers to build and share their own Opals!
