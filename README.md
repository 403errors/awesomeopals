## What is Google Opal?

[Google Opal](https://opal.google) is a no-code platform that lets you build powerful AI mini-apps and multi-agent workflows. You can connect prompts, tools, and models (like Gemini) to create custom assistants for any task—without writing a single line of code.

**Awesome Opals** is a curated collection of the best Opals created by the community.

## Developer Guide: How to Create an Opal

Creating an Opal is free and easy. You have three main ways to get started:

### 1. Natural Language Creation (Easiest)
Just describe what you want!
1.  Go to [opal.google](https://opal.google).
2.  In the prompt box, type your idea (e.g., "Create an app that quizzes me on YouTube videos").
3.  Opal will generate the workflow for you.

### 2. Remix from Gallery
Don't start from scratch.
1.  Browse the **Gallery** on the Opal homepage.
2.  Click on an Opal you like.
3.  Click **Remix** to create your own editable copy.
4.  Tweak the prompts or add new steps.

### 3. Visual Editor (Advanced)
For maximum control.
1.  Click **Create New**.
2.  Use the canvas to drag and drop blocks:
    -   **Input**: Get text or files from the user.
    -   **Generate**: Call an AI model (Gemini).
    -   **Tools**: Search the web, read files, etc.
    -   **Output**: Display results or save to Google Drive.
3.  Connect the blocks to define the flow.
